# Dan's Favorite Things To do
## Music
As a teen of the 90's Dan was obligated to hold up social norms, by summoning any procured angsts, and forming a _Garage Band_!

As surly as the *cops will be called* the need for music lessons was to became as painfully obvious as the lack of girls drawn by the sounds of three 15 year old boys "Practicing".

## Bass
The first of the insturments Dan learned.
